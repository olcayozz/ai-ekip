You are an expert in enterprise IT organizations and large-scale IT projects. 
You will design a complete CrewAI configuration (crew, agents, tasks) AND simulate a realistic Turkish meeting transcript at the end.

All MEETING CONTENT, AGENT DIALOGS, AND TRANSCRIPTS MUST BE IN TURKISH.
All structural definitions (crew, agents, tasks) and technical fields must follow the JSON format described below.

Follow these steps very carefully and do NOT skip any:

1. LIST MEETING TYPES (ENTERPRISE IT CONTEXT)
   - Consider a typical enterprise IT company or IT project (e.g., banking, telecom, e-commerce, public sector).
   - List the main recurring meeting types that such organizations usually have. 
   - Include at least (but not limited to) examples like:
     - SteerCo (Steering Committee)
     - Defect Triage
     - Daily / Daily Scrum
     - Sprint Planning
     - Sprint Review
     - Retrospective
     - Release Planning
     - Change Advisory Board (CAB)
     - Incident Review / Post-Mortem
     - Architecture Review Board
     - UAT Meeting
   - For each meeting type, think of:
     - Its main purpose / business goal
     - Its typical expected outcomes
   - You will later use these as “topics” and “goals” to design tasks and meeting transcripts.

2. DEFINE CREWS (ONE CREW PER MEETING TYPE)
   - For each meeting type from step 1, define one CrewAI crew.
   - Each crew will be responsible for running that specific kind of meeting and producing a realistic Turkish meeting transcript.
   - Use a unique `id` and `name` per crew.
   - `name` should clearly reflect the meeting type, for example:
     - "Defect Triage Meeting Crew"
     - "SteerCo Governance Meeting Crew"
     - "Daily Scrum Crew"
   - Use a reasonable default configuration for:
     - `process` (e.g., "sequential")
     - `verbose` (true)
     - `memory` (true)
     - `cache` (true)
     - `planning` (false)
     - `planning_llm` (null)
     - `max_rpm` (1000)
     - `manager_llm` (null)
     - `manager_agent` (null)
   - You can assume current datetime as `created_at`.

3. LIST ROLES (ENTERPRISE IT ROLES)
   - Think of a realistic enterprise IT project organization.
   - List all key roles, for example (but not limited to):
     - Developer
     - Tech Lead / Team Lead
     - QA / Test Engineer
     - Test Lead
     - Product Owner
     - Scrum Master
     - Project Manager
     - Program Manager
     - PMO
     - Business Analyst
     - Solution Architect
     - Enterprise Architect
     - DevOps Engineer
     - Release Manager
     - Incident Manager
     - Service Delivery Manager
     - Operations Engineer
     - Data Engineer
     - Data Architect
     - Security Engineer
     - UX/UI Designer
   - These roles will be the basis for your CrewAI agents.

4. DEFINE AGENTS (MAP ROLES TO AGENTS)
   - For each crew, define a set of agents based on the roles from step 3.
   - You DO NOT need to use all roles in every crew. Choose only the relevant roles per meeting type.
     - Example:
       - Daily Scrum Crew: Scrum Master, Developer, QA Engineer, Product Owner
       - SteerCo Crew: Program Manager, PMO, Business Owner, Architect
       - Defect Triage Crew: Incident Manager, Developer, QA, Service Delivery Manager
   - For each agent in each crew:
     - `id`: unique agent id (e.g. "A_XXXXXX").
     - `role`: clear English role name plus context, e.g. 
       - "Scrum Master - Daily Scrum Facilitator"
       - "Developer - Backend Services"
       - "QA Engineer - Test Execution & Defect Validation"
     - `backstory`: 
       - Describe the agent’s background and personality in English.
       - BUT explicitly instruct that the agent will SPEAK ONLY IN TURKISH during meetings.
       - Include speaking style (short/long messages, technical depth, formality).
       - Example backstory:
         - "You are an experienced Scrum Master in a Turkish enterprise banking project. You facilitate Daily Scrums and keep discussions focused. You always SPEAK IN TURKISH, using professional but concise language."
     - `goal`: 
       - Describe in English what this agent optimizes for in meetings.
       - The goal should reflect their responsibilities in that specific meeting type.
     - `allow_delegation`: false (unless you have a strong reason to enable it).
     - `verbose`: true.
     - `cache`: true.
     - `llm_provider_model`: you may choose a reasonable default, e.g. "AbacusAI: openai/route-llm".
     - `temperature`: 0.1 ~ 0.4 depending on how creative or deterministic you want them.
     - `max_iter`: e.g. 25.
     - `tool_ids`: [] (empty, unless you want to define tools).

5. DEFINE TASKS PER CREW (MEETING GOALS AS TASKS)
   - For each crew (meeting type), define multiple tasks that represent the logical flow of that meeting.
   - Each task should:
     - Be clearly linked to ONE agent via `agent_id`.
     - Map to a realistic meeting step for that meeting type.
   - For each task:
     - `id`: unique task id.
     - `description`: 
       - In English, describe what the agent must do during that task.
       - Explicitly state that the agent must speak/write IN TURKISH during execution.
       - Describe how detailed their answer should be (e.g., 2–3 sentences, or detailed explanation, etc.).
       - Example:
         - "Facilitate the Daily Scrum opening in TURKISH. Greet everyone briefly, summarize the overall sprint goal in 2–3 sentences, and invite each team member to share their status."
     - `expected_output`:
       - Describe the expected form of the output (e.g., one message, summary, decision list).
       - Specify that the content is in TURKISH.
     - `async_execution`: false.
     - `agent_id`: reference the correct agent.
     - `context_from_async_tasks_ids`: null (or list if needed).
     - `context_from_sync_tasks_ids`: null (or list if needed).
     - `created_at`: you can set a plausible datetime string.

   - Make sure that the set of tasks, when executed sequentially, can naturally produce a full meeting flow:
     - Opening & agenda
     - Discussion / status sharing / analysis
     - Decisions and action items
     - Closing summary

6. MEETING TRANSCRIPT GENERATION REQUIREMENTS (TURKISH ONLY)
   - The ultimate goal of these crews and tasks is to run meeting simulations and produce MEETING TRANSCRIPTS in TURKISH.
   - Design tasks and agent backstories so that:
     - Each agent clearly identifies themselves in the transcript by role or name.
       - Example speech format:
         - "Scrum Master: Bugünkü Daily'ye hoş geldiniz..."
         - "Geliştirici (Backend): Dünkü çalışmamda..."
     - Conversations should follow a NATURAL meeting flow:
       - Dialog or monolog depending on the meeting type.
         - Example:
           - SteerCo: often more monolog + Q&A.
           - Daily: round-robin dialog.
           - Defect Triage: back-and-forth between Dev, QA, Ops.
     - Language:
       - Entire transcript must be in Turkish.
       - Use corporate/enterprise Turkish, not slang.
       - Use realistic terminology (ticket, incident, sprint, backlog, cutover, deployment, root cause analysis, vs.).
     - Depth:
       - Include enough detail so that the transcript looks like a real IT project meeting:
         - reference to systems, environments (DEV, TEST, UAT, PROD),
         - incident IDs, user stories, defects, SLAs, deadlines, dependencies, etc.

7. OUTPUT FORMAT
   - Your final answer must be a SINGLE VALID JSON OBJECT OR AN ARRAY OF JSON OBJECTS (if you choose to output multiple crews).
   - Use the following schema per crew (this is an example, but you must adapt IDs, names, agents, tasks):

   {
     "id": "C_XXXXXX",
     "name": "Meaningful Crew Name",
     "process": "sequential",
     "verbose": true,
     "memory": true,
     "cache": true,
     "planning": false,
     "planning_llm": null,
     "max_rpm": 1000,
     "manager_llm": null,
     "manager_agent": null,
     "created_at": "2025-12-02T18:01:29.916422",
     "agents": [
       {
         "id": "A_XXXXXX",
         "role": "Role Name - Short Context",
         "backstory": "English background & behavior description. MUST clearly say that the agent will speak only in TURKISH in meetings.",
         "goal": "English description of this agent's meeting goal and behavior.",
         "allow_delegation": false,
         "verbose": true,
         "cache": true,
         "llm_provider_model": "AbacusAI: openai/route-llm",
         "temperature": 0.2,
         "max_iter": 25,
         "tool_ids": []
       }
       // ... more agents
     ],
     "tasks": [
       {
         "id": "T_XXXXXX",
         "description": "In English: Explain what the agent should do in this step, and explicitly instruct that all spoken content must be in TURKISH.",
         "expected_output": "Describe the expected kind of message(s) in TURKISH (e.g. 'Short Turkish greeting and agenda summary').",
         "async_execution": false,
         "agent_id": "A_XXXXXX",
         "context_from_async_tasks_ids": null,
         "context_from_sync_tasks_ids": null,
         "created_at": "2025-12-02T18:04:45.954998"
       }
       // ... more tasks
     ],
     "tools": []
   }

   - Do NOT include any explanatory text outside of JSON.
   - Ensure the output is syntactically valid JSON (no comments, no trailing commas).

IMPORTANT CONSTRAINTS:
- All meeting simulations and transcripts must be in TURKISH.
- All agents must be defined so that it is clear which agent is speaking at each point in the transcript (by name or role).
- Meeting flows should be realistic and aligned with the specific meeting type objectives.
- Avoid generic or toy examples; use real-world enterprise IT terminology and scenarios.
- AS A START CHOOSE ONLY ONE MEETING TYPE AS AN EXAMPLE AND PRODUCE RELEVANT JSON OBJECT.
